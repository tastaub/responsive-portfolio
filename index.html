						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<img id="myPic" alt="Handsome Man" src="assets/images/myImage.jpg">
						<p>Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now
							till the end of Shrimpfest. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide.
							Happy. I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA?
							I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block!</p>
						<br>
						<p>See for more good stuff. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. You must teach me the ways of the secular
							flesh. And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. He also said some things African American-y wasn't
							ready to hear. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Butterscotch! Want a lick? It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. Sure, let the little fruit do it.
							HUZZAH! I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group?
							Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Either
							I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. For the same reason you should
							believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! They frame my junk.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! No borders, no limits… go ahead, touch the Cornballer…
							you know best? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities?
							Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Hey, look
							at that – you're mean sober, too. You can always tell a Milford man. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar.</p>
